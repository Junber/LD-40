P:
Oh god, I really have to get pissed before that birthday party.
B:
I'm sure I can help you with that.
P:
I'm glad we share the same sentiment.
B:
What can I bring you, man?
P:
A # will do for now.
B:
You got it.
P:
*gulp*
Ahhh, that hits the spot.
B:
So you have to attend a birthday party today?
P:
Yes. My great great aunts 96th birthday.
Its gonna be fun.
And by fun I mean torture.
B:
Sucks, bro.
P:
So that's why I'm getting drunk.
Like really really drunk.
B:
Understandable.
I can't remember a single birthday in the last couple of years
Where I didn't end up on the guest toilet to puke my guts out.
Unfortunately I can't have you do this in this bar man.
P:
Nah that's ok.
Wanted to do some bar-crawlong anyway.
Whoops, look at the time.
Off to the next bar I go.
B:
See you.
Try not to puke on the cake.
Hahaha.
Ha.
