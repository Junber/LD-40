B:
Good evening, Mr.
How may I help you?
P:

What's on the menu?
B:
You can coose between...

P:
I'll go with the # then.
Why are there only two choices?
Are you out of anything else?
B:
Nope.
My outstanding barkeeper sense told me you would enjoy these two options the most.
P:
Wow, really? That's impressive.
B:
Nope.
P:

B:
Look, kiddo.
I don't make the fucking rules here.
If you don't like our selection why don't you go to a different bar?
P:
No that's ok, I like my #.
See?
*Gulp*
Delicious!
(This night of bar-crawaling and debauchery has just begun
And someone is already trying to ruin my mood. What a great start.
I better leave this place, before this "barkeeper" makes me wanna punch his face.)
Well have a good night.
B:
Hmph.
