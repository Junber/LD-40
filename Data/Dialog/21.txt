P:
Haha!
New bar, new luck.
B:
Hey what can I do for you?
P:
Could you make my great great aunt disappear?
HAHAHAHA!
B:
I don't think so.
I was thinking about a drink for you.
P:
Oh yes of course.
A # please.
B:
There you go.
P:
Thank you.
*gulp*
B:
May I know the reason for your great great aunts implied disposal?
P:
Ah well you know how it is.
She is the typical old family-member hag that wants kisses,
Pinches cheeks,
Smells like a Russian whore and...
Ah you now the drill.
And today is her birthday.
B:
My condolences.
Is that why you inhaled your drink, Sir.
P:
Haha, yes.
Wasn't my first one today.
And it sure as hell won't be the last one.
Okay, I gotta leave.
I wouldn't want this bar to be the only one getting filthy rich today night.
Ahaha!
B:
Come again.
