P:
Good evening gentlemen.
B:
Hello Sir,
A drink for you?
P:
You know it!
A # please, shaken, not stirred.
B:
...
Was this a motherfucking James Bond reference?
P:
I beg your pardon?
(Grinning inside, like a child that believes he is both grossly funny and smart at the same time)
You mean this superhero?
(Grin widens)
B:
Ah, 't doesn't matter.
P:
*gulp*
I always wanted to be a superhero, you know?
Flying around, protecting people.
Getting all the ladies.
B:
Who doesn't?
P:
Most superheroes.
They always seem to be somewhat unhappy with their lives.
Like retreating to their "fortress of solitude" or whatever.
Stupid, if you ask me.
B:
Good thing I didn't ask you then.
P:
:c
You know, sometimes when I'm drunk I feel like a superhero.
Part of the reason why I'm drinking I guess.
B:
Aha. Good for you.
P:
Well I gotta go.
Maybe you will here of my heroic stunts tomorrow in the morning newspapers.
Aahahahaha.
B:
...
Oh boy.
