Hello Mr. Barkeeper.
What do you have in store for me today?
B:
What you see is what you get.
Choose whatever floats your boat.
P:
Well if that's the case, how 'bout a #?
B:
# coming right up.
P:
*gulp*
So...
How's work today?
B:
Oh, pretty good. We got a new client and the bank will make a lot of money.
P:
(What the heck is he talking about? Guess I'll play along)
What client?
B:
I cannot tell you; it's confidential.
P:
(Is this even going anywhere?)
Aw, come on. Why not?
B:
No, I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?
P:
Uhm...
Blimey!
Look at the time, I gotta go.
(I feel like I had this conversation before)
