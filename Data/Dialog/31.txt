B:
What about #?
P:
Well it won't do you any good on that shelf.
B:
I guess not.
... There you go.
P:
Thank you Lloyd.
*gulp*
B:
I'm sorry but my name is not Lloyd, Mr.
P:
Ah I know.
Aahaha.
It's a quirk of sorts.
B:
I see.
P:
Have you ever seen "The Shining"?
B:
I'm afraight I didn't.
P:
A shame.
Good movie.
Very scary.
You could assume it was made to hurt people.
B:
And that is good, Sir?
P:
Well...
I guess that is remarkable for a movie.
B:
If you say so.
P:
Well the protagonist talks to an imaginary barkeeper.
Or ghost barkeeper.
It's not made clear.
B:
Hmhm.
P:
And he calls him Lloyd.
B:
Yes, yes.
P:
He is a remarkable barkeeper.
Like yourself.
B:
I'm happy to hear that, Sir.
P:
Wicked.
Well, I must take my leave now.
B:
...
:/
Bye, Sir.
