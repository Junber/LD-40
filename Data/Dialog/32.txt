Back,
When I was a little girl in France,
We used to pick pretty daisies.
The boys from the village
Would whisper my name.
"Peter."
"Oh, Peter."
"Why don't you show us that fine ass?"
B:
Now I'm pretty sure I shouldn't have given you that drink.
P:
Ohhh, don't be so cold.
I just shared a little childhood memory with you.
B:
You wanna hear a bit about my childhood?
P:
Why, of course I would.
B:
My dad used to beat me up every Friday night.
He usually was pretty drunk.
Much like you right now.
P:
(Oh boy, that sure ruined the mood)
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, I gotta go now.
