P:
Helloooo people!
It's I, Peter!
B:
Why good evening Peter.
Pleased to meet you.
But could you please keep your voice down a bit?
P:
Ahaha!
Of course, no big deal.
B:
Good.
P:
Good?
Just "good"?
So, what I believe you are trying to say is "thank you".
B:
Thank you?
P:
You're welcome! :)
B:
What?
No, no, no.
I didn't-
I wasn't-
P:
(Doubtful face)
*singing* Okay, okay, I see what's happening here
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that bartenders never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Peter, breathe it in
I know it's a lot: the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod
What can I say except "you're welcome"?
For-
B:
Maybe "I'll go now".
So do you want to buy a drink before I kick you out?
P:
Ah yes, I'll have a # please.
B:
There you go.
P:
*Gulp*
Thank you!
B:
What can I say except "you're welcome!"?
And now, please leave.
P:
K, bye.
(How rude)
