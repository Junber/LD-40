Oh man, thats the most fun I've had this evening.
Most barkeepers were real spoilsports.
But you are different.
Ah...
Do you know why so many bars seem to be closed tonight?
B:
Well, we received a call from the police.
Warning us about a shady drunk visiting countless bars
And causing a ruckus...
By making bad jokes and pop-culture references.
P:
Oh my god that sounds awful.
B:
I know right?
Many bars closed for tonight because they didn't want the trouble.
P:
Understandable,
Well have a nice night asznee!
B:
You too, my man.
And never forgett:
Men can never be hot.
Perspiration thing.
