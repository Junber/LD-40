P:
Heyho, Mr. Barkeeper.
What's crackin'?
B:
Until you arrived...
Not that much.
P:
Good good.
You know, I had this VERY strange dream.
B:
...
Okay.
P:
I was in a room.
B:
Mhm.
P:
And I didn't want to leave the room.
B:
Aha.
P:
There were people outside.
B:
No shit.
P:
Mean people.
B:
Oh okay.
P:
Or that's what I made myself believe.
ANYWAY
So I wasn't leavin the room.
And my mum called.
B:
Go on I'm listening.
P:
But I wasn't feeling like talking to her.
So I trashed the phone.
B:
Savage.
P:
And shit just got weird from there on.
B:
Okay.
How 'bout a drink by the way?
P:
Yes, a coke please.
B:
Excuse me?
P:
I'm jesting ahaha.
A # will do for now.
*Gulp*
Where was I?
Ah yes, so shit got weird.
B:
I'm all ears.
P:
My room got really messy.
*hic*
And there was this flamingo lamp.
I didn't remember buying one but the design was neat.
B:
Uhu. How neat?
P:
Like insanely neat.
I'd buy merch of it if there was flamingo lamp merch.
I gave him the name flamingod.
Because of a bug and his superior appereance.
And because he lectured me about my shortcomings.
B:
Haha, what a story man.
What bug?
P:
I'm afraight I have to go now.
My planet needs me.
