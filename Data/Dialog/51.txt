P:
Brrrrb!
B:
Are you OK Sir?
P:
Lloyd?
Is that you again?
I didn't realize it was you.
Gee-whiz in how many bars can you be
At the same time?
(I guess that's the best barkeeper in the world for you.)
You l-loo
Loooo-
Looked so different!
Did you get a new haircut?
B:
I'm afraight it's the same as always, Sir.
P:
Sad!
I liked your previous one...
Bet-
Better.
B:
I'm sorry to hear that, Sir.
P:
AH CRAB NIPPLE!
B:
... Crab?
Nipple?
P:
A whole lotta crab nipple.
I tell you Lloyd,
Beware of the crab nipple.
B:
I appreciate the warning.
But at the same time I wonder
If that warning was the sole purpose for your visit.
P:
AH!
AHHHH!
B:
...
P:
I'm sorry a crab #, please.
B:
Crab # coming right up.
Are there other wisdoms you'd like to share?
P:
*Gulp*
Ahh, yes.
Garlic doesn't help to deflect vampires.
B:
I'm well aware of this, Sir.
P:
Oh, blimey!
Well that's
Imb-
Imbariss-
Embarassing.
I'd like to leave now.
B:
Beware of the crab nipple.
