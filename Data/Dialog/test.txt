P: 
YES!
Ah, this smell...
Old wood, booze and...
A faint note of puke and sweat.
I was born for this.
B:
Are you finished Sir?
P:
Yes, yes.
Of course.
B:
What will it be?
P:
I’ll have a # please.
B:
# coming right up Sir.
P:
Thank you Lloyd.
B:
That is not my name Sir.
P:
Oh, yes!
Right.
Sorry.
*Gulp*
B:
Any plans for tonight Sir?
P:
I have to attend the birthday of my great great aunt.
But before that,
I’m getting completely wasted!
AHAHAHA!
Haaaa.
Yes.
How else could you stand something like that?
B:
I hope you don’t plan on doing this in our bar, Sir.
P:
Oh Lloyd, always so cold.
I’m already on my way.
B:
I hope you will have a wicked evening, Sir.
